    <p><b>Video 2, Tripwire creation.</b> This video demonstrates how a user
    creates a tripwire using our browser extension interface. In this example
    they create a new tripwire folder called work by selecting the neighboring
    folder, duplicating the element, and modifying the content and path. They
    preview and save this tripwire which then persists after refreshing. While
    the UI is enabled it highlights existing tripwires in blue and they can be removed by
    clicking on them. </p>
